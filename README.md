# Lagrange-Points
MATLAB code that computes 5 particular solutions of the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem in any given system, also known as Lagrange Points.

Input:
In the file Lagrange_Points_Main, input the desired mass parameter and Gamma guess values starting on Line 11.
On Line 21, select desired integration tolerance.
Starting on Line 32, change plotting input values for desired system computation.
Run script.

Output:
A table of the Lagrange Point coordinates.
A plot of the system and Lagrange Point locations.
